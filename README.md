Bioinformatic project that datamines social media discovering epidemic transmission of disease.
This application uses the Twitter global datasets to discover people tweeting symptoms of
disease globally.  By using clustering techniques and time series analysis, we should be able
to estimate the R0 of a POSSIBLE disease and observe the SIR (Susceptable, Infected, Removed) data points based on the frequency of mined tweets.

GOOGLE does something similar with proprietry data aimed at identifying influenza epidemics/pandemics.

Twitter data is available in an open manner.  APIs are readily available.

This project is using AngularJS, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Python.  Later we will add some limited local store using Mongo/Redix.
